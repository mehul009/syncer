# syncer
By this python coad you can take a backup in your hard-drive for your ubuntu

For this you have to feed a data in 'shutil.csv' 
Here you find two coloums 
1) only_file  
2) with_dir

If you only want to backup filke from those folders than enter data in this column(name like folder/sub_folder  do not wright like /home/user/folder/sub_folder)

And if you want to backeup whole directory with subfolder and it's subfolder recursively than add thosw folders name in this line( you also add folder/sub_folder)

After this 
run this coad on a hard-drive by simply write 'python3 syncer.py'
