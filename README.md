By this python coad you can take a backup in your hard-drive for your windows

For this you have to feed a data in 'shutil.csv' 
Here you have to make column with your partiton alphabet(ex: for D drive only write D  or follow the given file)

put backup folders data in those column(name like //folder//sub_folder)

After this 
run this coad on a hard-drive by double click on it.
